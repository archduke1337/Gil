## 🔄 WHY CRAWLING MAY BE SLOW

### 1. **New Website**
- Your website is relatively new (launched recently)
- Google typically takes 1-4 weeks to fully index new sites
- Initial crawling can be sporadic

### 2. **Domain Authority**
- New domain with no backlinks yet
- Low domain authority means slower crawling frequency
- Google prioritizes established domains

### 3. **Content Volume**
- Need more content pages to attract regular crawling
- Single-page sites get crawled less frequently
- More internal linking helps

1. Use "URL Inspection" tool
