        While colorless diamonds have long been the standard of perfection, colored diamonds—known as 
        "fancy" diamonds in the trade—represent some of nature's rarest and most valuable treasures. 
        Understanding the extraordinary conditions required to create these gems helps us appreciate 
        why certain colors command prices that can exceed those of the finest colorless diamonds.
      </p>

      <h2>The Science Behind Diamond Color</h2>
      <p>
        Diamonds form deep within the Earth's mantle under extreme pressure and temperature. Pure diamond 
        consists only of carbon atoms arranged in a cubic crystal structure, which would produce a perfectly 
        colorless stone. However, the presence of trace elements or structural anomalies during formation 
        creates the spectacular array of colors we see in fancy diamonds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The color in diamonds results from three primary causes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trace elements:</strong> Nitrogen creates yellow, boron produces blue, and hydrogen can 
        contribute to violet or purple hues.</li>
        <li><strong>Structural defects:</strong> Plastic deformation of the crystal lattice creates pink, 
        red, purple, and brown colors.</li>
        <li><strong>Natural irradiation:</strong> Exposure to naturally occurring radiation can create green 
        diamonds, though this is extremely rare.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Rarity Spectrum</h2>
      
      <h3>Red Diamonds: The Ultimate Rarity</h3>
      <p>
        Red diamonds are the rarest of all colored diamonds, with fewer than 30 true red diamonds known to 
        exist worldwide. Most are under one carat, making larger specimens exponentially more valuable. The 
        Moussaieff Red, at 5.11 carats, is the largest known red diamond and is valued at over $20 million.
      </p>
      <p>
        The color results from a rare deformation in the diamond's atomic structure during formation. Unlike 
        other colors caused by impurities, red diamonds are pure carbon, making their color mechanism one 
        of gemology's most intriguing mysteries. The Argyle mine in Australia, before its closure in 2020, 
        was the primary source, producing perhaps one or two red diamonds per year.
      </p>

      <h3>Blue Diamonds: Ocean Depths</h3>
      <p>
        Blue diamonds owe their color to trace amounts of boron incorporated during crystallization. The 
        presence of boron also makes blue diamonds semiconductive—a unique property among gems. Only about 
        0.02% of diamonds show any blue coloration, and those with pure, intense blue are extraordinarily rare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Famous examples include the Hope Diamond and the Wittelsbach-Graff Diamond. Blue diamonds typically 
        form at greater depths than other diamonds (400-600 miles below the surface), which explains both 
        their rarity and their unique properties. Recent research suggests they may form in oceanic crust 
        that has been subducted into the mantle.
      </p>

      <h3>Pink Diamonds: Millennial Treasures</h3>
      <p>
        Pink diamonds result from structural deformation rather than trace elements. The intense pressure 
        that creates this distortion is so specific that pink diamonds are found in very few locations 
        worldwide. The Argyle mine produced 90% of the world's pink diamonds, though only 0.01% of its 
        production showed pink color.
      </p>
      <p>
        The closure of the Argyle mine has made pink diamonds even rarer, with prices increasing dramatically. 
        Investment-grade pink diamonds have appreciated by 116% over the past decade, outperforming many 
        traditional investment vehicles. The Graff Pink, sold for $46.2 million in 2010, exemplifies the 
        extraordinary value these gems can achieve.
      </p>

      <h3>Green Diamonds: Nature's Accident</h3>
      <p>
        Natural green diamonds are among the rarest colors because their formation requires a precise and 
        unusual set of circumstances. The green color typically results from natural radiation exposure 
        over millions of years, usually affecting only the diamond's surface. Diamonds with green color 
        throughout the entire stone are exceptionally rare.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Dresden Green, perhaps the most famous green diamond, demonstrates the stability of naturally 
        irradiated diamonds. Many green diamonds require careful analysis to confirm their color is natural 
        rather than the result of laboratory irradiation, making certification crucial for these stones.
      </p>

      <h3>Orange Diamonds: Sunset Gems</h3>
      <p>
        Pure orange diamonds are extraordinarily rare, with most orange stones showing secondary hues of 
        brown, yellow, or pink. The color results from a specific type of nitrogen structure combined with 
        structural defects. The Pumpkin Diamond, a 5.54-carat Fancy Vivid Orange stone, sold for $3 million 
        and remains one of the finest examples of this color.
      </p>

      <h3>Purple and Violet: Royal Colors</h3>
      <p>
        Purple and violet diamonds are so rare that even many experienced gemologists have never seen one. 
        The color likely results from a combination of crystal distortion and hydrogen impurities. The 
        Royal Purple Heart, the largest known purple diamond at 7.34 carats, is considered priceless due 
        to its unique characteristics.
      </p>

      <h2>The Grading of Colored Diamonds</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike colorless diamonds where absence of color increases value, fancy colored diamonds are valued 
        for the intensity and purity of their color. The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) grades 
        colored diamonds on three characteristics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hue:</strong> The dominant color and any modifying colors</li>
        <li><strong>Tone:</strong> The lightness or darkness of the color</li>
        <li><strong>Saturation:</strong> The strength or intensity of the color</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Color grades range from Faint to Fancy Deep, with Fancy Vivid being the most valuable for most colors. 
        A shift from Fancy Intense to Fancy Vivid can double or triple a diamond's value.
      </p>

      <h2>Market Dynamics and Investment Potential</h2>
      <p>
        Colored diamonds have shown remarkable appreciation over the past two decades. Pink diamonds have 
        led the market with average annual returns of 13.8%, while blue diamonds have appreciated by 
        12.4% annually. This performance has attracted investors seeking alternatives to traditional assets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several factors drive this appreciation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Absolute rarity with no possibility of increased supply</li>
        <li>Growing wealth in emerging markets, particularly Asia</li>
        <li>Limited mining sources, with key mines like Argyle now closed</li>
        <li>Increased awareness and appreciation of colored diamonds</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Future of Colored Diamonds</h2>
      <p>
        With the closure of the Argyle mine and no new significant sources of colored diamonds discovered, 
        natural fancy colored diamonds will become increasingly rare. While laboratory-grown colored diamonds 
        are available, they lack the rarity and investment potential of natural stones.
      </p>
      <p>
        For collectors and investors, colored diamonds represent the ultimate in rarity—natural treasures 
        that took billions of years to form under conditions so specific they may never be replicated. As 
        supply continues to diminish and demand grows, these extraordinary gems will likely continue their 
        trajectory as some of Earth's most valuable natural resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether viewed as investments, collector's items, or simply objects of beauty, colored diamonds 
        remind us of nature's capacity to create the extraordinary from the ordinary—transforming simple 
        carbon into gems of unparalleled beauty and value through the perfect confluence of chemistry, 
        physics, and time.
