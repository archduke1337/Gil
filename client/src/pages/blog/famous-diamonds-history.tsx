        Throughout history, certain diamonds have captivated humanity with their extraordinary beauty, 
        immense size, and the dramatic stories surrounding their discovery and ownership. These legendary 
        gems have adorned royalty, sparked international intrigue, and even been blamed for bringing 
        misfortune to their owners. Let's explore the fascinating histories of the world's most famous diamonds.

      <h2>The Hope Diamond: A Tale of Beauty and Curse</h2>
      <p>
        Perhaps no diamond is more famous—or infamous—than the Hope Diamond. This stunning 45.52-carat 
        deep-blue diamond has a history spanning over 350 years. Originally known as the Tavernier Blue, 
        it was purchased by French gem merchant Jean-Baptiste Tavernier in India around 1666.
      </p>
      <p>
        The diamond was sold to King Louis XIV of France, who had it recut into a 67-carat stone known 
        as the "Blue Diamond of the Crown of France" or simply the "French Blue." During the French 
        Revolution, the crown jewels were stolen, and the French Blue disappeared for two decades.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1812, a deep blue diamond appeared in London, owned by diamond merchant Daniel Eliason. This 
        stone, later proven to be recut from the French Blue, eventually made its way to Henry Philip Hope, 
        from whom it takes its current name. The Hope family owned the diamond for nearly a century before 
        financial difficulties forced its sale.
      </p>
      <p>
        The diamond's supposed curse began with Pierre Cartier, who sold it to American socialite Evalyn 
        Walsh McLean in 1911. To make the sale more enticing, Cartier embellished tales of misfortune 
        befalling previous owners. While many of these stories were fabrications, they captured the public 
        imagination. Today, the Hope Diamond resides in the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, 
        where millions marvel at its beauty without fear of any curse.

      <h2>The Koh-i-Noor: Mountain of Light</h2>
      <p>
        The Koh-i-Noor, meaning "Mountain of Light" in Persian, is one of the largest and most 
        controversial diamonds in the world. Weighing 105.6 carats in its current form, this diamond 
        has a history intertwined with the rise and fall of empires across the Indian subcontinent.
      </p>
      <p>
        First mentioned in written records in 1628, the Koh-i-Noor was likely mined from the Kollur 
        Mine in present-day Andhra Pradesh, India. For centuries, it adorned the Peacock Throne of 
        the Mughal emperors. The diamond changed hands numerous times through conquest, passing through 
        Persian, Afghan, and Sikh rulers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1849, following the British annexation of Punjab, the diamond was ceded to Queen Victoria 
        as part of the Treaty of Lahore. Prince Albert had it recut from 186 carats to its current 
        105.6 carats to increase its brilliance, though many lamented the loss of size. The Koh-i-Noor 
        became part of the British Crown Jewels, set in the Queen Mother's Crown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, the diamond remains a source of international controversy, with India, Pakistan, Iran, 
        and Afghanistan all claiming rightful ownership. The British government maintains that the 
        diamond was obtained legally and refuses to return it, making the Koh-i-Noor a symbol of 
        colonial history and ongoing cultural disputes.

      <h2>The Cullinan Diamond: The Largest Ever Found</h2>
      <p>
        Discovered in 1905 at the Premier Mine in South Africa, the Cullinan Diamond remains the 
        largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found, weighing an astounding 3,106.75 carats (about 1.37 pounds). 
        Named after the mine's chairman, Thomas Cullinan, this extraordinary find would yield nine major 
        stones and 96 smaller brilliants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Transvaal government purchased the diamond and presented it to King Edward VII as a birthday 
        gift in 1907. The task of cutting this magnificent stone fell to the Asscher brothers of Amsterdam, 
        renowned diamond cutters. Joseph Asscher spent months studying the diamond before attempting the 
        first cleave. Legend says he fainted after successfully making the first cut, though the Asscher 
        family denies this dramatic account.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two largest stones cut from the Cullinan are Cullinan I (the Great Star of Africa) at 530.4 carats, 
        and Cullinan II (the Second Star of Africa) at 317.4 carats. Cullinan I, the largest clear cut 
        diamond in the world, is set in the head of the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross. Cullinan II adorns 
        the Imperial State Crown. Both are part of the British Crown Jewels housed in the Tower of London.

      <h2>The Orlov Diamond: A Soldier's Theft</h2>
      <p>
        The Orlov Diamond, a 189.62-carat stone with a distinctive half-egg shape, has one of the most 
        romantic—if possibly apocryphal—origin stories among famous diamonds. According to legend, the 
        diamond once served as the eye of a Hindu deity statue in a temple in southern India.
      </p>
      <p>
        The story goes that in the mid-18th century, a French soldier deserted his post and converted 
        to Hinduism to gain access to the temple. After earning the priests' trust, he stole the diamond 
        and fled to Madras, where he sold it to an English sea captain. The stone eventually made its 
        way to Amsterdam and into the hands of Court Jeweller Ivan Lazarev.
      </p>
      <p>
        Count Grigory Orlov, a former lover of Empress Catherine the Great of Russia, purchased the 
        diamond in 1776 for 400,000 rubles—an enormous sum at the time. He presented it to Catherine 
        in an attempt to regain her favor. While the romantic gesture failed to rekindle their relationship, 
        Catherine accepted the gift and had the diamond mounted in the Imperial Sceptre, where it remains 
        as part of the Kremlin Diamond Fund.

      <h2>The Dresden Green: Nature's Marvel</h2>
      <p>
        The Dresden Green Diamond stands unique among famous diamonds for its remarkable natural green 
        color and its role in advancing our understanding of diamond formation. Weighing 41 carats, 
        this pear-shaped diamond gets its color from natural radiation exposure over millions of years—a 
        process that scientists have studied extensively using this very stone.
      </p>
      <p>
        First mentioned in a 1742 letter from Baron Breteuil to Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, the 
        diamond was purchased by Augustus III of Poland in 1742 at the Leipzig Fair. It has remained 
        in Dresden, Germany, for most of its known history, surviving both World War II (hidden in the 
        Königstein Fortress) and the Cold War.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Dresden Green's scientific importance cannot be overstated. When the Hope Diamond was 
        discovered to phosphoresce red after exposure to ultraviolet light, scientists compared it to 
        the Dresden Green to understand how natural radiation affects diamond color. This research has 
        helped gemologists identify treated diamonds and understand the natural processes that create 
        fancy colored diamonds.

      <h2>The Taylor-Burton Diamond: Hollywood Glamour</h2>
      <p>
        In the world of famous diamonds, few capture the intersection of Hollywood glamour and exceptional 
        gems quite like the Taylor-Burton Diamond. This 68-carat pear-shaped diamond became a symbol of 
        one of cinema's most passionate and tumultuous love stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally rough weighing 241 carats, the diamond was discovered in the Premier Mine in South 
        Africa in 1966. Harry Winston purchased and cut the stone, which was first sold to Mrs. Paul 
        Ames, sister of Walter Annenberg, the U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the diamond came up for auction in 1969, Richard Burton was determined to buy it for his 
        wife, Elizabeth Taylor. He was outbid by Cartier but negotiated to purchase it from them for 
        $1.1 million—making it the most expensive diamond sold at public auction at that time. The 
        conditions of the sale included allowing Cartier to display the diamond, now called the 
        "Cartier Diamond," in their stores.
      </p>
      <p>
        Burton presented the renamed Taylor-Burton Diamond to Elizabeth Taylor on their yacht while 
        moored in Monaco. Taylor wore it publicly only twice due to the massive security required. 
        After her second divorce from Burton, Taylor sold the diamond in 1978 for $5 million, donating 
        a portion to charity. Its current whereabouts remain unknown to the public.
      </p>

      <p>
        These legendary diamonds represent more than just valuable gems; they are artifacts of human 
        history, witnesses to the rise and fall of empires, symbols of love and power, and objects 
        of scientific study. Each carries stories of the people who owned them, the cultures that 
        treasured them, and the circumstances that made them famous.
