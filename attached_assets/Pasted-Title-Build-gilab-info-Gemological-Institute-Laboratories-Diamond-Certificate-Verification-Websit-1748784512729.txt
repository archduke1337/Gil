Title: Build gilab.info - Gemological Institute Laboratories Diamond Certificate Verification Website with Admin Upload Panel

Description: Create a modern, professional website named gilab.info for Gemological Institute Laboratories (GILab), a diamond lab verification service. The website must include:

Public Verification Page:
A clean, user-friendly page where customers can enter their diamond certificate reference number.
Upon submission, the site displays the diamond certificate details and provides a download/view link to the certificate (PDF or image).
If the reference number is not found, show a clear "Certificate not found" message.
Admin Panel:
Secure login page for the admin (use a fixed username/password for simplicity).
After login, an admin dashboard to upload diamond certificates.
Admin can input a unique reference number, upload the certificate file, and submit.
Uploaded certificates are saved with the reference number for later retrieval.
Admin sees a list of uploaded certificates with their reference numbers and upload dates.
Technical Requirements:

Use Node.js with Express framework to build the backend.
Use Multer middleware for handling file uploads.
Store uploaded certificate files in a dedicated directory on the server.
Store metadata (reference number, filename, upload timestamp) in a JSON file or in-memory store.
Serve a public endpoint to allow verification of certificates by reference number.
Implement minimal frontend using EJS or plain HTML/CSS/JS for simplicity.
Style the site professionally with a modern look (nice fonts, colors matching a gemological theme).
Bonus:

Responsive design that works well on mobile and desktop.
Validation on admin form to ensure unique reference numbers.
Deliverables:

Fully functional Node.js Express app.
Public route "/" for verification input.
Admin routes "/admin" for login and "/admin/dashboard" for uploads and listing.
